# Pie Chart

![Example Pie Chart - NA](/test/media/default_demo_p0va0.png)

> A pie chart (or a circle chart) is a circular statistical graphic which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice (and consequently its central angle and area), is proportional to the quantity it represents. While it is named for its resemblance to a pie which has been sliced, there are variations on the way it can be presented. The earliest known pie chart is generally credited to William Playfair's Statistical Breviary of 1801.  [^https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart]

## Existing Functionality
* feature, config options [example]()
* feature, config options [example]()

## Sample Data
* Data that demonstrates X (low count?)
* Data that demonstrates Y (high count?)
* Data that demonstrates Z (non zero?)

# Development Plan

## Phase 1 Functionality
* Unlimited datapoints per chart
* Limited dataset size of 1MB
* Reads native visualization JSON format
* Data labels per section
* Data point animations on dataset change
* Unlimited viewport sizing
* Variable whitespace between slices
* Slice offset (emphasis)
* Inner circle (for doughnut)

## Phase 2 Functionality
* Native accessibility
* Additional format compatibility
* Coordinate with Canada.ca and WET to aid integration
* Automated Testing via CI

## Phase 3 Functionality
* Rounded pie corners
* On hover labels

## Phases N
* Area colours, transparency, native style (hatch, lines, symbols), loadable style (images, svg)
* Save output, svg, png
